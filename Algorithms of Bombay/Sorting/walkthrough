// COUNTING SORT
      /*
      As we have seen in the lectures, 
      the lower worst case bound for any comparison based sort is O(n*log(n)), 
      where n is the size of the input array. Can we do any better?

      It turns out that in some particular cases we can. 
      If all elements are in the range 0 to k, we can sort the array in O(n+k) time. 
      This is achieved using counting sort.

// Description
      /*
      As we know that all the numbers are in the range 0 to k, 
      we can just make an array of size k+1 to store the count of each number.

      In the end we can just print each element the number of times it occurs.

      Time Complexity: O(n+k)

// RADIX SORT
      /*
      We saw in counting sort how to sort an array of size n 
      if all elements are in the range 1 to k, in 0(n+k) time. 
      What if the elements vary from 1 to n^2. 
      Counting sort will take O(n^2) time in this case. 
      Can we sort such an array in linear time? Radix sort comes to our rescue.

      Radix sort is a very interesting sorting method. 
      It is used to sort data by grouping elements on the basis of digits that share the same significant position. 
      That is, we sort digit by digit, from the least to the most significant digit. 
      Counting sort is used as a part of radix sort.
      */

// Description
      /*  
      As we can see in the image, 
      we sort the numbers on the basis of the least significant digit to the most significant digit (in base b).

      Suppose the numbers vary from 1 to k. 
      The number of digits in base b is O(log_b(k)). 
      We use counting sort to sort the numbers on the basis of these digits 
      (we know that the digits range from 0 to b-1 in time O(n+b). 
      Thus the overall complexity is O((n+b)*logb(k)).

      Note that if k = n2, we choose b = n and we get complexity O(n)!

Step 1: Find the maximum possible most significant digit. Call this D. 
        Note that D = log_b(k) where b is the chosen base 
        and k is the maximum value that the numbers of the array can take. 
Step 2: Iterate from the least significant to the most significant digit (i = 0 to D).
Step 3: In each iteration sort the numbers in the given array on the basis of their digit at position i. 
        Note that the digits vary from 0 to b-1 since we have represented each number in base b.
Step 4: Make sure that for numbers that have the same digit at position i, 
        their relative position remains the same. (Think why?)
Step 4: The array we obtain finally is sorted. */

// SHELL SORT
      /*
      Shell sorting is a very interesting sorting method which basically uses insertion sort to sort elements. 
      So if it uses insertion sort then how it is better than insertion sort? 
      Well that's the interesting part. 
      To get the intuition, 
      shell sort applies insertion sort first to small sequences of largely interleaved elements 
      which makes the array kind of partially sorted 
      and then it repeatedly reduces the interleaving between the elements of sequence 
      and reapplies insertion sort untill we get the sorted array. 
      Already confused ? don't worry, It is lot to grasp in one sentence.

// Problem with insertion sort
      Insertion sort is a great algorithm, because itâ€™s very intuitive and it is easy to implement, 
      but the problem is that it makes many exchanges for an element which is very far from its correct place. 
      Thus these elements may slow down the performance of insertion sort a lot. 
      That is why in 1959 Donald Shell proposed an algorithm 
      that tries to overcome this problem by comparing items of the list that lie far apart

      Shell sort vs Insertion sort

// Description
      First lets define h-sorted list. 
      We say a list is h-sorted if starting from any position every hth element is in sorted order. 
      For e.g. 2 1 4 3 is 2-sorted list while 3 1 2 4 is not since starting 
      from initial position every second element i.e. 3 and 2 is not in sorted order.

      Shell sort takes a gap sequence (lets call it gap_seq). 
      This sequence must be a decreasing sequence and must end with 1. 
      Now for each element gap_seq[i] in the gap sequence, 
      shell sorts makes the array gap_seq[i] sorted by sorting every gap_seq[i] interleaved elements.

      For e.g. take gap_seq = {5, 3, 1}
