What is an Algorithm?
  An algorithm is a set of step-by-step procedures, or a set of rules to follow, for completing a specific task or solving a particular problem.
  The word algorithm was first coined in the 9th century
  
  Algorithmic programming is all about writing a set of rules with a finite number of steps that instruct the computer how to perform a task
  A computer program is essentially an algorithm that tells the computer what specific steps to execute, in what specific order, in order to carry out a specific task
  
  Types of Algorithms
    - Divide and Conquer Algorithms
    - Brute Fore Algorithms
    - Randomized Algorithms
    - Greedy Algorithms
    - Recursive Algorithms
    - Backtracking Algorithms
    - Dynamic Programming Algorithms
    
    Why are Algorithms Important to Understand?
      Algorithmic thinking allows students to break down problems and conceptualize solutions in terms of discrete steps
