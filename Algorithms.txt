What is an Algorithm?
  An algorithm is a set of step-by-step procedures, or a set of rules to follow, for completing a specific task or solving a particular problem.
  The word algorithm was first coined in the 9th century
  
  Algorithmic programming is all about writing a set of rules with a finite number of steps that instruct the computer how to perform a task
  A computer program is essentially an algorithm that tells the computer what specific steps to execute, in what specific order, in order to carry out a specific task
  
  Types of Algorithms
    - Divide and Conquer Algorithms
    - Brute Fore Algorithms
    - Randomized Algorithms
    - Greedy Algorithms
    - Recursive Algorithms
    - Backtracking Algorithms
    - Dynamic Programming Algorithms
    
    Why are Algorithms Important to Understand?
      Algorithmic thinking allows students to break down problems and conceptualize solutions in terms of discrete steps
      

ARRAYS
Arrays are defined as the collection of elements of same data type
Array is the simpliest data structure where each data element can be randonly accessed by using its index number

--Array declaration in C language
Data_type array_name[size]
eg: int arr[10]

Array Memory representation
      0  1  2  3  --> index
      5 10 15 20  --> value
      
--Properties of Array
1. Each element is of same data type and carries a same size i.e. int = 4 bytes.
2. Elements of the array are stored at contiguous memory locations.
3. Elements of the array can be randomly accessed.

--Array Use Case
If we want to store price of 4 different pens
we use variables to store price like this
    price1 = 10
    price2 = 14
    price3 = 5
    price4 = 3
    
we could simply use an array to store these values
    int pen_price[10, 14, 5, 3]
If we want to access an element from this array, we could use its index number.

For example we can access the value "5" by using its index number "2" like this
    print(pen_price[2]) 

Example: to find out the output
    int mark1[10]
    int mark2[14]
    mark2 = [8, 25, 789, 4, 2, 7, 8, 9, 45, 78]
    mark1 = [1, 0, 2, 45, 85, 5, 8, 0]
    print(mark2[5])   # 7
    
TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAY
Array of Arrays are called 2D array
The 2D array is organized as matrices which can be represented as the collection of rows amnd columns

2D Array declaration in C language
Data_type array_name[rows][columns]
eg: int arr[3][3]

2D Array representation(a[3][3])

      a[0][0]   a[0][1]   a[0][2]
